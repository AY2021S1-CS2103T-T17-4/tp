## Project: Projact

Projact is a **project management app that helps NUS computing students to organise their fellow computing students' contacts and their teams' meeting links and tasks**. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### New Features
* **Feature**: Added the command to list the tag list.
  * What it does: allows the user to list all the tags that have been created. 
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to keep track of all the tags that have been added and allows extensions of the tag features.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects the tag commands which can be extended further in the future.

* **Feature**: Added the commands to sort the list of contact names and the list of tag names.
  * What it does: allows the user to sort the contact names in the person list or the tag names in the tag list based on numbers then in alphabetical order. 
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to change how the contacts and tags are viewed in the list based on their personal preference.
  
* **Feature**: Added the command to delete the link in a tag.
  * What it does: allows the user to remove the link added to a tag.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product as the user is able to add a link and needs a way to remove the link from the tag as well.
  
* **Feature**: Added the command to mark a task's status in a tag as done.
  * What it does: allows the user to mark a task in the task list of a tag as done.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to keep track of the progress of the tasks added to each tag.
